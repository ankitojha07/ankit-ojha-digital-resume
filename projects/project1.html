            <p>Where there is unity, there is always victory!" GeeksforGeeks Student Chapter LPU is one of the highly renowned student organisations on-campus. It is most famous for two things: it's super competitive hackathons and the kind of passion it instills in the hearts of budding coders.</p>

            <p>Re-Designed and Developed Official website for GeeksforGeeks-LPU. Previous design was not upto the mark and cards were too old fashioned. I tried to use latest design patterns and color combinations.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Developed the official website for the community using next JS</li>
                <li>Configured user cards using JSON data to change it dynamically</li>
                <li>View all the previous events, upcoming events, and blogs from GeeksforGeeks"</li>
                <li>Deployed using Netlify Server and GitHub.
